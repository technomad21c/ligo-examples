(** Regions of a file

   A {e region} is a contiguous series of bytes, for example, in a
   text file. It is here denoted by the object type [t].
 *)

(** {1 Definition} *)

(** The start (included) of the region is given by the field [start],
    which is a {e position}, and the end (excluded) is the position
    given by the field [stop]. The convention of including the start
    and excluding the end enables to have empty regions if, and only
    if, [start = stop], which a fast and easy check. See module {!
    Pos} for the definition of positions.

      The first byte of a file starts at the offset zero (that is,
    column one), and [start] is always lower than or equal to [stop],
    and they must refer to the same file.
    {ul

      {li The call [region#shift_bytes n] evaluates in a region that
          is the translation of region [region] of [n] bytes forward
          in the file.}

      {li The call [region#shift_one_uchar n] is similar to
          [region#shift_bytes n], except that it assumes that [n] is
          the number of bytes making up one unicode point.}

      {li The call [region#set_file f] sets the file name to be [f].}

      {li The method [file] returns the file name.}

      {li The method [pos] returns the values of the fields [start]
          and [stop].}

      {li The method [byte_pos] returns the start and end positions of
          the region at hand {e interpreting them as lexing
          positions}, that is, the unit is the byte.}

      {li The call [region#to_string ~file ~offsets mode] evaluates in
          a string denoting the region [region], in the manner of the
          OCaml compilers.}

      {li The name of the file is present if, and only if, [file =
          true] or [file] is missing.}

      {li The positions in the file are expressed as horizontal
          offsets if [offsets = true] or [offsets] is missing (the
          default), otherwise as columns.}

      {li If [mode = `Byte], those positions will be assumed to have
          bytes as their unit, otherwise, if [mode = `Point], they
          will be assumed to refer to code points.}

      {li The method [compact] has the same signature as and calling
          convention as [to_string], except that the resulting string
          is shorter (usually for debugging or tracing).}}

exception Invalid

(** The function [make] creates a region from two positions. If the
    positions are not properly ordered or refer to different files,
    the exception [Invalid] is raised.

(** {1 Special regions} *)

(** To deal with ghost expressions, that is, pieces of abstract syntax
    that have not been built from excerpts of concrete syntax, we need
    {e ghost regions}. The module {! Pos} provides a [ghost] position,
    and we also provide a [ghost] region and, in type [t], the method
    [is_ghost] to check it. It is implemented as two [Pos.ghost]
    positions.  *)
val ghost : t

(** The call to [wrap_ghost] wraps a value within a ghost region.
 *)
val wrap_ghost : 'a -> 'a reg

(** Occasionnally, we may need a minimum region. It is here made of
    two minimal positions.
*)
val min : file:string -> t

(** {1 Comparisons} *)

(** Two regions are equal if, and only if, they refer to the same file
    and their start positions are equal and their stop positions are
    equal. See {! Pos.equal}. Note that [r1] and [r2] can be
    ghosts.  *)
val equal : t -> t -> bool

(** The call [lt r1 r2] ("lower than") has the value [true] if, and
    only if, regions [r1] and [r2] refer to the same file, none is a
    ghost and the start position of [r1] is lower than that of
    [r2]. (See {! Pos.lt}.) *)
val lt : t -> t -> bool

(** The call [compare r1 r2] has the value 0 if [equal r1 r2] returns
   [true]. Otherwise it returns -1 if [lt r1 r2] returns [true], and 1
   if [lt r1 r2] returns [false]. *)
val compare : t -> t -> int

(** Given two regions [r1] and [r2], we may want the region [cover r1
    r2] that covers [r1] and [r2]. We have the property [equal (cover
    r1 r2) (cover r2 r1)]. (In a sense, it is the maximum region, but
    we avoid that name because of the [min] function above.) If [r1]
    is a ghost, the cover is [r2], and if [r2] is a ghost, the cover
    is [r1].
